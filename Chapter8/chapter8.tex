Throughout the thesis, we have developed different solutions to privacy
preserving biometrics authentication. Starting from a protocol with an inspiring
technique of ciphertext packing but lacking of protection against malicious
client model, we constructed a Zero Knowledge Proof technique to provide
solution to the problem. The technique also help the protocol not to rely on any
trusted third party to keep the client's secret key for decrypting results from
homomorphic operations. In the next protocol, we discover that to fully support
multi-factor security, especially in the biometrics authentication context, the
circuit privacy problem needs to be solved efficiently. We proposed Renyi
Divergence technique in the security analysis so that the protocol can preserve
its security level while still keeping the parameter settings within practical
threshold, specifically, we showed that the noise of results from homomorphic
operations can be covered by not-too-large masks to add extra security to the
ciphertext result. The third variant was our first attempt to do all the
essential operations homomorphically: in addition to computing the Hamming
Distance, we also wanted to compare the ciphertext result with some threshold
value, under the malicious client model. Although the results were not practical
enough in terms of communication size, we learned different techniques to
balance the tradeoffs between communication and computation. In our last
version, we proposed another alternative that cover all the weakness of the
previous protocol. The solution include combinations of many advanced
cryptographic techniques: Homomorphic Encryption, Zero Knowledge Proof, Garbled
Circuit and Oblivious Transfer. However, we still notice a significant one time
setup cost.
