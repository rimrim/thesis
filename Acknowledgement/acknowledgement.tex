I would like to express my profound gratitude to my main supervisor, Dr Ron Steinfeld, for his inspired guidance and advice, his infinite patience, encouragement and support during my PhD years. I am deeply indebted to him for his kindness and understanding, in both academic, professional and personal aspects.

I am beholden to my co-supervisor Dr Nandita Bhattacharjee for her priceless confidence and enlightening guidance.

I offer all my thanks to the Monash MGS and MIPRS Scholarship for their financial aid.

Last but not least, my appreciative thoughts go to my father, my mother, my wife, my daughter and my brother for their great love, support and encouragement. A very special thanks to my close friend Tang who helped me a lot during the writing of this thesis.
